                Hong Kong faces increasing cybersecurity threats. According to The Hong Kong Computer
                Emergency Response Team Coordination Centre (HKCERT) statistics, common attacks
                including phishing attacks, ransomware, web server and app attacks and malware attacks
                (botnets) pose significant risks to the organizations and endangering personal data, financial
                assets and critical infrastructure for IT environment. This evolving threat landscape is
                intensified by the digitalization of more businesses in Hong Kong. With the rising trend
                mentioned above, organizations are expected to strengthen their cybersecurity measures in
                their IT environments. In addition, more regulatory requirements and guidelines will be
                introduced to protect the public interest and ensure the stability of various industries. An
                upcoming legal requirement, the Protection of Critical Infrastructure (Computer System)
                Bill, is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2026.
