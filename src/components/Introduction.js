                Our project focuses on streamlining cybersecurity incident reporting and compliance in Hong Kong using a centralized platform. The primary objectives of our project are to develop a user-friendly platform that evaluates the nature and overall criticality of incidents, provides clear guidance on Hong Kong’s regulatory requirements, generates compliant reports, and securely stores these reports for future reference by regulators, hoping to improve the efficiency and accuracy of incident management processes while ensuring alignment with local regulatory standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope of our investigation covers the review of (1) current and upcoming regulatory requirements for cybersecurity incident reporting in Hong Kong, (2) the design of the framework in evaluating the incident, (3) providing users with a recommendation on whether to make a report to the relevant regulators through our platform and (4) AI-powered advices on cybersecurity incident handling and management. Our platform is tailored to the needs of organizations in sectors with diverse reporting obligations. Our research is guided by both local and international standards, focusing on how best to support users in determining whether and how to make a report to the relevant authorities and manage cybersecurity incidents efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                The methodology involves conducting extensive research on Hong Kong’s regulatory framework, analysing current challenges in incident reporting, utilizing development techniques to create and refine the platform, which consists of (1) regulatory guidance and advice sections, (2) incident reporting form, (3) incident evaluation and report generation function and (4) incident storage database.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this project, we have delivered a fully functional platform that simplifies and standardizes incident reporting, reduces errors, and enhances compliance with local regulations. Ultimately, our purpose is to help organizations save time and resources while improving regulatory transparency and accountability across Hong Kong’s most critical industries.
